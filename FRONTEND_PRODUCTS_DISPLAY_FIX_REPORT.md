# ðŸŽ¯ Frontend Products & Categories Display - Fix Report

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Successfully fixed the frontend to display products and categories in the left navbar and main content area. The homepage now shows actual products instead of "No products yet" and "No categories available".

## ðŸ”§ Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **API Filter Issues**

- **Problem**: Product controller was filtering by `status: "active"` but products only had `isPublished: true`
- **Fix**: Removed `status: "active"` filter from:
  - `getAllProducts()` function
  - `getCategories()` function
  - `getFeaturedProducts()` function

### 2. **Frontend Filter Issues**

- **Problem**: Sidebar component was checking `product.status === "active"`
- **Fix**: Changed to `product.isPublished === true`

### 3. **No Featured Products**

- **Problem**: All products had `isFeatured: false`
- **Fix**: Created script to make 4 popular products featured
